    <h1>The Temple Invocation of Jakintza Ruha</h1>
    <h2>We gather beneath the four pillars, where earth, sky, time, and spirit meet.</h2>

    <div class="section">
      <p>We stand in remembrance, in resistance, in wonder. We stand in the temple of wisdom becoming magic.</p>

      <div class="pillar">
        <h3><a href="pillar1.html">I. Cultural Respect</a></h3>
        <p>We will not wear culture as costume.<br>
        We will not erase the blood, the struggle, or the memory.<br>
        We honor elders as living libraries, and we guard traditions from theft.<br>
        What we take, we give back. What we inherit, we protect.<br>
        Cultural respect is not accessory â€” it is justice.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="pillar">
        <h3><a href="pillar2.html">II. Cosmic Vision</a></h3>
        <p>We lift our eyes from the grindstone to the stars.<br>
        We remember that we are stardust made flesh.<br>
        We will not sever science from spirit, nor wonder from responsibility.<br>
        We dream futures worthy of our descendants, listening to the sky as scripture, living as luminous threads in a cosmic web.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="pillar">
        <h3><a href="pillar3.html">III. Ancestral Stewardship</a></h3>
        <p>We walk with the dead and the unborn.<br>
        We will not allow our ancestors to be erased.<br>
        We speak the names of the silenced, we repair what we can, we plant seeds we may never see grow.<br>
        To forget is to die twice. To remember is to live forever.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="pillar">
        <h3><a href="pillar4.html">IV. Integration of Magic & Science</a></h3>
        <p>We will not choose between microscope and moonlight.<br>
        We honor ritual as technology and technology as ritual.<br>
        We treat questions as prayers, and knowledge as devotion.<br>
        We heal with medicine and with magic.<br>
        We remember: integration is wholeness, and wholeness is power.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="section">
        <h3>Together</h3>
        <p>We build the temple.<br>
        We live the pillars.<br>
        We remember what the empire tried to erase.<br>
        We reclaim what was stolen.<br>
        We rise as ancestors in training, threads of a cosmos that sings through us.</p>

        <p><strong>This is Jakintza Ruha.<br>
        This is remembrance.<br>
        This is the path home.</strong></p>
