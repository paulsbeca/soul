What Jakintza Ruha Means to Me

A Soul Testimony by Beca Davila

I was born into Catholicism — baptized, blessed, and handed a Bible before I ever had the language to say no. I was raised to kneel, to obey, to fear. But even as a child, something ancient stirred in me — something wild and unscripted.

At fourteen, I bought my first oracle deck and hid it under my bed like it was contraband and sacred all at once. I printed spells off a dusty old website called spellsandmagic.com like they were scripture for girls like me — girls who heard whispers in the wind and knew the moon was more than a rock in the sky. I started a Book of Shadows with shaky hands and a thundering heart, not knowing why — just knowing I had to.

They called me the “witchy girl” in school.
I wore that like armor.

But then I fell in love. And love, when you don’t know yourself yet, can be a dangerous thing.

My ex-husband was raised in the strict arms of the Black Christian South — by a mother who saw anything outside the Bible as demonic. He looked at my altar like it was a battlefield. My crystals, my cards, my spells — he called it all evil. And when you’re young and trying to belong, you believe love means sacrifice.

So I threw it all away.
Every tarot deck. Every page of spells. Every piece of the girl I was becoming.

From 19 to 23, I was deep in church — not just Sunday services, but full-on revival hours, twice a week. Hands raised. Voices crying out. And me, trying to smother the fire inside of me with gospel and good-girl guilt. I tried. Gods, I tried to be saved in the way they told me I had to be.

But the truth? I didn’t feel saved. I felt erased.

Their God was too small for my spirit. Their heaven too far removed from the earth I loved. I didn't want salvation — I wanted sovereignty.

And that’s when I started remembering.
Piece by piece, breath by breath — I reclaimed her.
The witchy girl. The one who danced under the stars and called it prayer.
The one who whispered to fire and felt her ancestors whisper back.

And that is when Jakintza Ruha was born.

Not as a school. Not as a business.
As a portal back to self.
As a place where my children — and yours — can learn who they are before the world teaches them to forget.
Where magic is the curriculum, spirit is the compass, and remembering is the revolution.

Jakintza means “wisdom” in Basque.
Ruha means “spirit” or “breath” — the same breath that was nearly stolen from me when I tried to shrink myself to fit someone else’s idea of holiness.

Now, I’m taking that breath back.
I’m giving it to every child who was ever told their light was dangerous.
To every grown woman trying to sew her soul back together after burning it at the altar of someone else's god.

Jakintza Ruha is for the ones who never stopped hearing the hum of the earth beneath their feet.
It is for the children who will grow up never having to choose between truth and tradition, because they will build their own.

This is my legacy. My rebellion. My remembering.

And I am never throwing it away again.
